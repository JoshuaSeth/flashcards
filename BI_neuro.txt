Q: What are the input and output of a neuron called
A: Axon

Q: By what are axons of different neurons connected?
A: synapses

Q: What are the 'fingers' of an Axon?
A: Dendrites

Q: What are helper cells for neurons?
A: Glial cells

Q: What types of glial cells are there?
A: Astrocytes, Schwann cells (myelin production), Microglial cells (blood brain barrier)

Q: What is the top-level separation of brain areas?
A: Cortex into 4 lobes and brain stem and cerebellum

Q: What does the frontal lobe do?
A: Thinking, memory, behaviour and movement

Q: What does the temporal lobe do?
A: Hearing, learning and feelings

Q: What does the brain stem do?
A: Heart rate, breathing and temperature

Q: What does the parietal lobe do?
A: Language and touch

Q: What does the occipital lobe do?
A: Sight

Q: What does the cerebellum do?
A: Movement and coordination

Q: What happens when you go from posterior to anterior parts of the frontal lobe?
A: You move from direct planned actions to more abstract planning

Q: Why has the brain very close communication between motor and touch?
A: Motor actions often lead to sensory data, the motor and sensory maps of body parts align almost perfectly

Q: What are the different ways to send signals?
A: 1. The basic direct action-potential 2. Neurotransmittor binds modulate the action-potential properties of the cells
