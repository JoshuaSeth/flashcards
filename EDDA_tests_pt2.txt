Q: Non-normal data, 2 samples, independent, test difference in distributions
A: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

Q: Non-normal data, 1 sample, test difference with distribution
A: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

Q: What is the difference between Komogor-Smirnov and Mann-whitney?
A: The latter only tests for difference in medians where the former test for difference in median, mean, variance (most properties of the distribution vs. only the locaiton of the distribution)

Q: Non-normal data, normal errors, 2 or more saples, independent, test difference between levels (samples)
A: One-way ANOVA

Q: Non-normal data, non-normal errors, all nij >5, 2 or more samples, test difference in medians
A: Kruskal-Wallis test

Q: Non-normal data, 2 or more samples, independent, test whether samples from different populations
A: Permutation test for independent samples

Q: What is the difference between Kruskal-Wallis test and Permutation test for independent samples?
A: The former requires every nij > 5 and tests for difference in medians where the latter tests whether samples came from different populations

Q: Non-normal data, normal errors, 2 or more samples x 2 or more samples, independent, test every factor + interactions
A: 2-way ANOVA

Q: Non-normal data, normal errors, 2 or more samples, dependent, test difference between levels (samples)
A: 1-way ANOVA with repeated measures

Q: Non-normal data, non-normal errors, 2 or more samples, dependent, test difference between levels (samples)
A: Friedman test

Q: What is the difference between the Friedman test on one side and Kruskal-Wallis and permutation test on the other side?
A: The former is for dependent samples (repeated measures) the latter are not. Both are for data with non-normal errors

Q: Non-normal data, 80% n>5, 2 factors with n levels both, test whether interaction between factors
A: CHi-square test

Q: Non-normal data, 2x2, 2 factors with 2 levels both, test whether interaction between factors
A: Fisher exact test

Q: No real assumptions, 2 samples, test for dependence, whether rho is 0
A: Simple Linear regression

Q: No real assumptions, 2 or more samples, test whether rho is zero which is: whether all beta's are zero
A: Multiple linear regression
