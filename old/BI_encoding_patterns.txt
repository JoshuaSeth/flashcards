Q: What is another name for blobology?
A: Univariate analysis

Q: What is the problem with blobology?
A: The thresholding problem of t values

Q: What is neoprhenology?
A: localizing functions in particular locations in the brain, however there is a big overlap in functions.

Q: What are the limitations of blobology?
A: 1. Cannot distinguish different stimuli types within ROI (pattern classification) 2. Reverse inference is hard (forward models)

Q: What allows multivariate us to do?
A: distinction between different stimuli types, instead of average activity we look for pattern of activity

Q: What does pattern classification do?
A: Infer activity from the pattern of brain state

Q: How did MVPA help?
A: 1. Focus moved from activation to information 2. Stimuli that activated the same region could now be picked apart 3. Allowed comparison between modalities

Q: How did MVPA not help?
A: Reverse inference problem remains, what is it really about the stimulus that causes an acitvation pattern

Q: What do enconding models allow us to do?
A: We can encode models with different parameters and test what models best fit the activation by this knowing what paramters neurons react most strongly to

Q: What would decoding look like for the encoding models?
A: Cross validation Leave-One-Outschema:Fit PRF's on all but one run:trainingTake activations of 'test' run,multiply % signal chance with PRF'sReconstruct visual stimulus frombrain activity: Predict position

Q: What type of regression can solve the problem of too many parameters?
A: Ridge regression

Q: What is the benefit og ridge regression of MVPA?
A: The beta weights are interpretable and the encoding model can be decoded to a decoding model
