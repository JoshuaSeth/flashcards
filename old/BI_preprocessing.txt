Q: How can we show both signal without a fixed hrf and without to many regressors?
A: Gamma basis fuctions as a hrf with a first time derivative and a dispersion derivative

Q: What is the problem with tryig to regress everything out in preprocessing?
A: The degrees of freedom decrease still lowering your t-value (overfitting)

Q: Name the five major preprocessing steps
A: 1. Distortion correction 2. motion correction 3. slice time correction 4. temporal filtering 5. spatial smoothing

Q: What is distortion correction
A: Distortion from objects in the scanner we try to fit images to a canonical b0 image of the subject

Q: How do we compensate motion from heartbeat ad respiration
A: Regress them out

Q: How do we compensate head motion?
A: Head motion regressots or interpolation or reference volume

Q: What is temporal filtering?
A: We filter out the drifts

Q: What are the costs and benefits of spatial smoothing
A: The noise is smoothed out so higher SNR but lower specificity

Q: How ca we use T1 anatomy?
A: To separate white and gray matter the gray matter is where the bold activitions take place

Q: What are 3 methods of multi subject FMRI registration
A: 1. Surface based registration 2. Standard FSL registration across participants 3. ROI analysis

Q: What are the disadvantages of FSL registration to a standard brain?
A: 1. MNI is standard brain without any detail 2. Old standard brain was a non-prototypical woman 3. Gyruses and sulci's collide into each other by the warping

Q: What are the disadvantages of surface based registration?
A: Specialist knowledge required

Q: What are the advantages of surface based registration?
A: Correspond to how the brain is organised, probably better statistics

Q: What two alignments do we need to do with fmri data?
A: EPI to T1 for within subject mapping and across-subject mapping
