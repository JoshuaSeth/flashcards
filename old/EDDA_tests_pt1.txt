Q: Normal data, 2 samples, dependent, interest in difference mean
A: paired t-test

Q: Normal data, 2 samples, independent, interest in difference mean
A: t-test

Q: Normal data 1 sample, compare mean_hat against mean
A: One-sample t-test

Q: Non-normal data, 2 samples, dependent, interest in difference medians
A: Sign test

Q: Non-normal data, 1 samples, interest in difference median_hat with median
A: Sign test

Q: Non-normal symmetric data, 2 samples, dependent, interest in diffference medians
A: Wilcoxon test

Q: Non-normal symmetric data, 1 sample, interest in diffference median_hat median
A: Wilcoxon test

Q: Non-normal data, 2 samples, independent, interest in difference medians
A: Mann-whitney test

Q: Non-normal data, 2 samples, dependent, interest in p for any test statistic
A: Permutation test

Q: What is the difference between Wilcoxon and Sign test?
A: The former requires symmetric data and has higher power where the latter doesn't. Both are for 1 sample of paired samples (not independent).

Q: What is the difference between the sign test and the Mann-whitney test?
A: The latter is applicable to two independent samples where the former isn't. Both measure difference in medians.

Q: What is the difference between Wilcoxon test and Mann-whitney test?
A: They use the same test code but the former is for  sample or dependent samples where the latter is for 2 independent samples

Q: Normal data, 2 samples, test whether they are dependent (correlate), test whether rho = 0
A: Pearson's test (or LM)

Q: Non-normal data, 2 samples, test whether they are dependent (correlate), test whether rho = 0
A: Spearman's test
